    <div class="discussion-body">
        <p class="question-body">You are performing a semi-annual capacity planning exercise for your flagship service. You expect a service user growth rate of 10% month-over-month over the next six months. Your service is fully containerized and runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard regional cluster on three zones with cluster autoscaler enabled. You currently consume about 30% of your total deployed CPU capacity, and you require resilience against the failure of a zone. You want to ensure that your users experience minimal negative impact as a result of this growth or as a result of zone failure, while avoiding unnecessary costs. How should you prepare to handle the predicted growth?</p>
        <ul class="answer-options">
                    <li class="correct-answer">A. Verify the maximum node pool size, enable a horizontal pod autoscaler, and then perform a load test to verify your expected resource needs. </li>
                    <li class="">B. Because you are deployed on GKE and are using a cluster autoscaler, your GKE cluster will scale automatically, regardless of growth rate. </li>
                    <li class="">C. Because you are at only 30% utilization, you have significant headroom and you won't need to add any additional capacity for this rate of growth. </li>
                    <li class="">D. Proactively add 60% more node capacity to account for six months of 10% growth rate, and then perform a load test to make sure you have enough capacity. </li>

You need to deploy a new release to the application that includes a feature urgently required by your largest customer. You have been told that the release has passed all unit tests. What should you do?</p>

        <ul class="answer-options">
                    <li class="">A. Create a single aggregated log sink at the organization level. </li>
                    <li class="">B. Create a log sink in each project. </li>
                    <li class="">C. Create two aggregated log sinks at the organization level, and filter by project ID. </li>
                    <li class="correct-answer">D. Create an aggregated log sink in the Dev and Prod folders. </li>

        <p class="question-body">Your company runs services by using multiple globally distributed Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Your operations team has set up workload monitoring that uses Prometheus-based tooling for metrics, alerts, and generating dashboards. This setup does not provide a method to view metrics globally across all clusters. You need to implement a scalable solution to support global Prometheus querying and minimize management overhead. What should you do?</p>
        <ul class="answer-options">
                    <li class="">A. Configure Prometheus cross-service federation for centralized data access. </li>

        <p class="question-body">You need to build a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized application in Google Cloud. Your development team uses a central Git repository for trunk-based development. You want to run all your tests in the pipeline for any new versions of the application to improve the quality. What should you do?</p>
        <ul class="answer-options">
                    <li class="">A. 1. Install a Git hook to require developers to run unit tests before pushing the code to a central repository.<br>2.
