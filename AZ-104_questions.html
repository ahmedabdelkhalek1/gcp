The configuration of the health probe and probe responses determine which backend pool instances will receive new flows. You can use health probes to detect the failure of an application on a backend endpoint. You can also generate a custom response to a health probe and use the health probe for flow control to manage load or planned downtime. When a health probe fails, Load Balancer will stop sending new flows to the respective unhealthy instance. Outbound connectivity is not impacted, only inbound connectivity is impacted.<br>Box 3: No -<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview </li>

VM5 does not belong to the registration virtual network though.<br>Box 2: No -<br>Forward DNS resolution is supported across virtual networks that are linked to the private zone as resolution virtual networks. VM5 does belong to a resolution virtual network.<br>Box 3: Yes -<br>VM6 belongs to registration virtual network, and an A (Host) record exists for VM9 in the DNS zone.<br>By default, registration virtual networks also act as resolution virtual networks, in the sense that DNS resolution against the zone works from any of the virtual machines within the registration virtual network.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-overview </li>
